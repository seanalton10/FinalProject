# Final Project

This project is a visualization analysis of the airline industry in 2017. We will use python to create an animated moving bar chart that compares a running count of weekly flight counts for the top ten airlines in the United States. The script requires that the user has pandas, warnings, and bar_chart_race installed using pip. The script also requries that the machine being used has ffmpeg installed (available here: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) to create the mp4 file. 

The final product can be seen by downloading the airlines.mp4 file and is also available below:

An additional animation without the fixed max is available below to demonstrate another version of a bar chart race.
