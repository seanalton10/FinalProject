# FinalProject

This project is a visualization analysis of the airline industry in 2017. We will use python to create an animated moving bar chart that compares a running count of weekly flight counts for the top ten airlines in the United States. The script requires that the user has pandas, warnings, and bar_chart_race installed using pip. The script also requries that the machine being used has ffmpeg installed (available here: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) to create the mp4 file. The final product can be seen by downloading the airlines.mp4 file. There is an additional 'airlines non fixed.mp4' file that shows the same data but with a moving max value.

Final animation is available below:
